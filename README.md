# Bingo PDF Generator

This project is a simple Flutter application that generates custom bingo PDF files. While the code structure is admittedly quick-and-dirty, it effectively serves its purpose - allowing users to create unlimited, customizable bingo cards without cost restrictions. The application uses the pdf package to generate bingo cards with features like:

- Custom grid sizes
- Multiple bingos per page
- Customizable colors and fonts
- Optional joker fields
- Back side printing support

Built as a weekend project, it prioritizes functionality over code elegance, but successfully delivers on its core purpose of free bingo card generation.
