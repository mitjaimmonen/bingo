# Bingo PDF Generator

This project is a quick and dirty Flutter application that generates custom bingo PDF files. The main focus of this project is to allow users to create unlimited, customizable bingo cards without cost restrictions. The application uses the pdf package to generate bingo cards with features like:

- Custom grid sizes: 4x4 or 5x5
- Multiple bingos per page
- Customizable colors and fonts
- Optional joker field with custom image
- Custom background images
- Back side printing support

## Usage

For background images, use standard portrait paper aspect ratio 1:âˆš2, such as A4. For joker imgae a square 1:1 aspect ratio is preferred.

Title and description can be designed directly on your background image if preferred, as the tool only supports two font choices.
